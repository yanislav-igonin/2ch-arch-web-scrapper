# 2ch-arch-web-scrapper
Script to parse all 2ch.hk **/b** archive into csv file.

## Prerequisites

???
* pipenv installed

Run to install all dependencies:
```sh
pipenv install
```
????



```sh
conda create -n 2ch-arch-web-scrapper python=3.9
```
In contrast, if you fail to specify an interpreter, as with conda create --name env-00, the environment won't appear in the list.

## Motivation
Want to roll into DS a little, so I decided to analyze 2ch threads with some metrics. Of course, firstly I need a dataset.
