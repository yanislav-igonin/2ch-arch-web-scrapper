# 2ch-arch-web-scrapper
Script to parse all 2ch.hk **/b** archive into csv file.

## Prerequisites
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

For https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments

In contrast, if you fail to specify an interpreter, as with conda create --name env-00, the environment won't appear in the list.

## Motivation
Want to roll into DS a little, so I decided to analyze 2ch threads with some metrics. Of course, firstly I need a dataset.
